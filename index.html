      Happy Birthday Doctor, dekho mujhe zyada toh pta nhi but han I really wanted ki kuch special aur appreciation toh tum deserve karti ho but ab yha se kya karta mai toh bht dimaag chalane ke baad thought why not to use something we learnt at "CMS" and this is all the basic so boring appearence pe na jaake effort pe jaana. Anyways don't take things on emotional note but jo bhi you went through today obv you can't forget but you can divert your mind. Aur kai maino mein i feel ki tum bas ek trophy ki tarah treat kiye jaate ho by some person and once you are attained tum bas ek shelf pe pade rehte. Toh not beating around the bush enjoy your upcoming year 2026 with all the happy people around yourself and dont underestimate your value, you are that person who is found very rarely .<br><br>
      - ADARSH
